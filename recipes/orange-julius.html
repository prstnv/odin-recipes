    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In the 1920’s, Julius Freed opened an orange juice stand in Los Angeles, but sales weren’t so great. His friend, Bill, made a less acidic, more frothy version
     of orange juice which Julius adopted and began serving at his OJ stand. People loved it and began ordering Orange Julius’ left and right. 
     In 1987 Dairy Queen bought the Orange Julius Company.</p>
     <p>Today, that famous orange drink made up of ice, orange juice, sweetener, milk and vanilla is still found in mall food courts. It’s kind of like an orange 
    juice smoothie, except it’s more creamy and frothy. We think it tastes like a melted orange creamsicle. This homemade orange julius recipe is so quick and easy 
    that even a kid can put it together. Best of all, it tastes just like the real version, which means we can make this at home whenever we want.</p>
